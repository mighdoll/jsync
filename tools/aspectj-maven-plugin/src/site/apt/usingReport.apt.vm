Configuring aspectj report


  Example of ajdoc report creation. 
  
  Note : Since this report is using tools.jar as a system scoped dependency 
  you will need to make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable 
  are set to a jdk, before you could use this report.
  Also we discovered that it does not work with jdk1.5.0, and you would
  need to upgrade your vm if this is the one you currently are using.
