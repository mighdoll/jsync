The DataSortable extends the jQuery UI Sortable plugin to be backed by
a jsync sequence.  Changes to the view update use jsync API calls to
update the sequence, and changes to the sequence update the view.

Options:

- inserted: function that is applied to new list item views after they
  are inserted in the list

- model: a jsync sequence

- render: either a fn model -> HTML, or a hash of {kind -> fn}, that
  is applied to sequence items

- rerender: if true, re-render items that are dragged from one list to
  another

- modelTranslator: a function that creates sequence items from incoming
  sequence items, in order to represent items that are dragged between
  connected lists by different models

Other options are passed through to ui.sortable.
