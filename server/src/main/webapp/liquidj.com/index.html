       LiquidJ provides transparent replication of object state between browser and server.

      <p> 
       Modify an object in the browser and it's sent to the server automatically.  Modify an object 
       in the server and it's transparently sent to the browser.

       <ul class="advantages">
         <span class="title"> You can use LiquidJ to: <span>
         <li> <strong>Easily persist javascript objects to the server</strong>.  LiquidJ saves you from writing ajax
         boilerplate each time you write code that modifies data.  You just define the data types you care 
         about, and LiquidJ does change detection and ajax stuff automatically.
          </li>
         <li> <strong>Drop in UI widgets that know how to save and load their state. </strong> LiquidJ enhanced versions
         of are drop in extensions to existing UI widgets.  jQuery.UI widgets are included, and it's easy to 
         data enhance your favorite widget too.
         </li>
         <li> <strong>Create richer javascript apps by separating data from markup.</strong> LiquidJ helps enable
         a programming style that moves dynamic view logic out of the server and into the browser.  You
         can load complex data easily.  By avoiding server round trips by rendering changes locally, you
         can build richer and faster interactivity.
         </li>
         <li> <strong>Use Comet (server push).</strong>  LiquidJ automatically pushes object changes in 
         both directions - Comet is built in.  So when fresh messages or other data is available, the user can
         see it immediately, no need for a manual page refresh or a timer.  And if your users open multiple windows
         open, they'll all be kept up to date automatically.
         </li>
       </ul>
