* document internals

later:
* move array utilities out of array, it's rude.  $util or $sync.util instead.
* rename id and kind to $jsyncId and $jsyncKind to reduce conflict with user classes
* override field = to warn on firefox
* redo linked list modifications to send as edits?  reconsider design..
* better use of public namespace
* add example view controller: notes set, list explorer?
* add caller-groups parameter to subscribe to allow groupwise unsubscribe
* consider local only fields whose changes aren't propagated to the server
  * e.g. _foobar
* rename subscribe to emphasize two way comms?
* add version vectors to make it easier to identify conflicts on the server

much later:
* multiple connections
* pageable data structures
* one way syncing (e.g. dropbox)
* support for inheritance in syncable objects

-------------------

done:
* replace "Lee." namespace: ($sync, $debug, $util for now?)
* reformat to 8 space tabs everywhere
* add copyright notices everywhere
* revive other tests to verify changes from server
* minimize necessary utility methods
* send changes to server and test (use watchEvery)
* verify watchEvery on collections too
* use field_() istead of setField()
* set prototype fields, not object itself
* don't create fields for id and kind
* publish on github
* revise documentation
* send json text up
